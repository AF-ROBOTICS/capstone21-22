    "### Setting Up The NUC\n",
    "1. The NUC comes with Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS already, so you will not need to worry about installing any of those packages.\n",
    "<br/>\n",

    "1. Login:\n",

    "    There are two setups that have been used: An isolated local network and an internet enabled network (Makerspace). The main difference is the availability of a DHCP server, which is only available on the internet connected networks. Instalation is similar for each with key differences.\n",
