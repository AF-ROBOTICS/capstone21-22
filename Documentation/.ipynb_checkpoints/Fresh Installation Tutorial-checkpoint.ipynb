    "#### C1C Matthew U. DeMaso, C1C Anthony Tolbert\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up The NUC\n",
    "1. The NUC comes with Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS already, so you will not need to worry about installing any of those packages.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Login:\n",
    "        Username: robotics***\n",
    "        Password: dfec3141\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open a new Terminal on the NUC <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install the following libraries using *sudo apt install xxx*<br/>\n",
    "        a. rospy\n",
    "        b. time\n",
    "        c. signal\n",
    "        d. csv\n",
    "        e. copy\n",

    "        i. numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the NUC to the Network\n",
    "    There are two setups that have been used: An isolated local network and an internet enabled network (Makerspace). The main difference is the availability of a DHCP server, which is only available on the internet connected networks. Instalation is similar for each with key differences.\\n\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Connect to the network with the GUI (using \\\"Moku_Station_3_5Ghz\\\" as an example).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Isolated LAN ONLY\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the Wi-Fi settings to configure the IP settings:\n",
    "             a. Select the gear icon next to the network name\n",
    ">![](gear.png)\n",
    "             b. Select the IPv4 tab and change IPv4 Method to \"Manual\"          \n",
    "             c. Use the IP address format for your router (likely 192.168.1.xxx) to give the NUC a unique IP.\n",
    "             d. As of now the IP addresses are 192.168.1.2XX and 192.168.1.1XX for the NUCs and robots respectivly where XX is replaced with either the usafabot number or NUC number (i.e. robotics2 = 192.168.1.202 & usafabot22 = 192.168.1.122)\n",
    ">![](IPsettings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add other nodes' IP addresses to hosts file. The file can be copied from any of the other NUCs or robots, but the NUC should be added to the file first and copied to all NUCs and robots.\n",
    "             a. The file is located is */etc/hosts* and can be modified by nano with sudo permissions.\n",
    "             b. The file can also be copied via SCP.\n",

    "### Setting Up the Robot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the Robot to the Network\n",
    "    Adding a robot to the network is similar to the NUCs and should be done on the robots locally (not via SSH). Changes take effect after a reboot.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Connect the robot's Pi to a monitor and keyboard then turn it on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After Ubuntu launches, Login:\n",
    "             Username: pi\n",
    "             Password: dfec3141\n",
    "             \n",
    "3. *sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml* Change the network settings and IP address to match the robot\n",
    ">![](yamlFile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add other nodes' IP addresses to hosts file. The file can be copied from any of the other NUCs or robots, but the robot should be added to the file first and copied to all NUCs and robots.\n",
    "             a. The file is located is /etc/hosts and can be modified by nano with sudo permissions\n",
    "             b. The file can also be copied via SCP.\n",
