    "\n",
    "1. Inspect robot condition. Wheels fully seated on axles, motors fully depressed into housing, wires out of the way of wheel wells. Check battery charge on 10,000 MAh battery pack (above 30%). Check charge of AA-Batteries underneath Chassis (Must be changed weekly).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensure all robots have the proper pin connections (Red, Brown, Yellow, Orange to pins 4, 6, 8, 10 respectively).\n",

    "7. Ensure */rosout* is running. Each robot (usafabot0-24) after running rosnode list has the following nodes, *usafabot**/bot_to_map, */controller, */roadrunner, */robot_state_publisher, */serial*.\n",
