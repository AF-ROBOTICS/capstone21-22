Not an actual run of waterfall. 

This a run of a test program to "brute force" all potential phrases through the PathBuilder algorithm.

While each phrase was not printed in the log file the program started with "A" and was meant to run until "ZZZZZ"

This program was allowed to run from 18 March until 29 March and ran the algorithm for phrases from "A" to "AAF"

Some phrases took more than a day to compute and in extreme cases more than 3-5 days.

This could potentially be fixed by optimizing the bot locations for PathBuild, but each failed attempt will still take over a million "drawn" lines
